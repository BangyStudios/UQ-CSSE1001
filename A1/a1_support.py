Game rules - You have to guess letters in place of the asterixis. 
Each vowel guessed in the correct position gets 14 points. 
Each consonant guessed in the correct position gets 12 points. 
Each letter guessed correctly but in the wrong position gets 5 points. 
If the true letters were "dog", say, and you guessed "hod", 
you would score 14 points for guessing the vowel, "o", in the correct 
position and 5 points for guessing "d" correctly, but in the 
incorrect position. Your score would therefore be 19 points.
